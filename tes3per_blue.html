        <h1 style="color: white" align="center">Tesla model 3 performance</h1>
<h3 style="color: white">Tesla Model 3 is the all-electric entry-level sedan from Tesla Inc. and we decode why Tesla Model 3 managed to attract such high number of buyers and why is it so special?
    <br><br>If you are a fan of Marvel’s Iron Man in reel-life, you have to know about Elon Musk, the real-life Iron Man. While it’s not appropriate to draw parallels between an imaginary comic character and a real-life human, you just can’t ignore the similarities between the two. Both of them have worked towards the advancement of science and keep on bringing new technologies, which are much ahead of their time.
    
     Musk is currently at the helm of three companies that include Paypal, Tesla Inc. (formerly known as Tesla Motors), and SpaceX. <br><br>We are more interested towards the Tesla Inc., a company that pioneers in manufacturing all-electric luxury cars. Today, Tesla Inc. is valued more than some of the biggest names in the automotive industry and that’s not bad at all, given that Tesla Motors is just over a decade old.
    
    
    Tesla Motors has already given us cars like the Model S luxury sedan and Model X luxury crossover. But it was the announcement of the Tesla Model 3 that took the electric-car game to a whole new level. Let us decode why Tesla Model 3 managed to attract such high number of buyers and why is it so special?
    
    
    <br><br>Budget Sedan
    
    <br><br> Elon Musk has been very clear about the positioning of his brand’s cars in the market. Tesla sells only luxury all-electric cars and not budget cars. So when Tesla announced the entry-level Model 3, the market got berserk. Tesla priced the Model 3 for $35000 (base model) and within no time, received 1 lakh+ bookings.
    
    As of now, total bookings stand at 2 lakh cars. That’s a huge number by any means and going by the current rate, it will take at least 3 years to complete the current orders delivery. And that too when we are not counting the ongoing bookings. Tesla had to build a new Gigafactory just to cater the battery supply for the Model 3.
    
    <br><br> Range
    
    <br><br>Any electric car has that essential mileage issue, given the limited infrastructure to charge the electric cars. Simply put, you can refill your gasoline car if it runs dry, but the chances of charging your electric car in case of dried up batteries would be immensely low. Tesla, on the other hand, promises to be a game changer here.
    
    Elon Musk has promised that the new Model 3 will have a mileage of 215 miles (350 kms) for the base version. Get yourself a higher variant with a bigger battery and you will get an all-electric range of 300 miles (480 kms). That’s a highly respectable number for any electric car in the market today, and this is what gives the Tesla cars an edge over the other electric car manufacturers.

    <br><br>Acceleration
    
    <br><br>A fast electric car is a rare breed. We have an exception of the Formula E championship, but then those cars use extremely expensive technology, that can’t be replicated in a mass-produced car. Because a fast electric car will drain the battery too fast, leaving you searching for charging stations. But the Tesla cars are a different league altogether. The new Model 3 promises to run 0-100 kmph in 5.7 seconds. It has a Ludacris mode too, that will push the Model 3 from standstill to 100 in under 3 seconds.
    
    <br><br>Autopilot mode
    
    <br> <br>Believe it or not, autonomous driving is a part of today’s cars and the autonomous cars will soon be part of our daily transport system. Tesla’s Autopilot is arguably the most advanced autonomous-driving system available today. And the Tesla Model 3 will come equipped with this high-tech Autopilot system which relies on eight cameras providing 360-degree visibility around the car.
    
    It has a 250-metre range and also 12 ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles, other vehicles and even pedestrians. Tesla is working to make this system, still, it’s the best system yet. Tesla provide yearly updates to the system that can be downloaded into each and every Tesla car’s brain; irrespective of their model year.
    
    <br><br> India Launch
    
    <br><br>The coolest thing, though, is that the Model 3 will mark the Tesla’s debut in India. We are not sure when and how it will happen, but Elon Musk is in talks with the government to set up a base in the country. Also, given the price of the international spec model, Indian model could very well be priced close to Rs 35 Lakhs, making it a worthy buy in this price range.</h3>
