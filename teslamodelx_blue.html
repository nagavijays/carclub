            Since its release, the Tesla Model X has been subject to a series of updates in its software and hardware. <br><br>Here are 7 interesting facts about this cutting edge vehicle;
            
            <br><br>1. It pioneered as the first all-electric SUV and was released as the second vehicle from Tesla’s second generation platform.
            
            <br><br>2. Initially, Tesla has shipped a few thousand Model X SUVs with 6 and 7-seat configuration. However, recent reports have revealed that Tesla is set to introduce a 5-seat configuration.
            
            The company proudly claims it to be the best-in-class vehicle that is equipped with a second row bench seat that folds flat for this 5-seat configuration.
            
            The interior cargo storage opens up to 88 cubic feet and is designed with a 60/40 split to recline separately, or fold down entirely flat for additional cargo space.

            <br><br>3. Although it is not recommended, the Tesla Model X could tow up to 3,500 pounds on 22” wheels. When outfitted with 20” wheels, the Tesla X towing capacity can increase to 5,000 pounds.
            
            
            <br><br>4. With its Falcon wing doors, the company realized the impracticality with regards to storing outdoor equipment, like skis and snowboards.
             Tesla designed a way for the owner to conveniently stow their skis and snowboards on the exterior of their model X.
            
            The ski and snowboard carrier can be easily assembled and now allows a lockable storage with soft rubber coated arms that secure equipment and reduce the risk of scratching the surface of either the stowed equipment or the vehicle itself.
            
            The carrier can accommodate up to 6 pairs of skis or 4 snowboards.

The keyfob detection was refined for improved smart automatic front door behavior as you enter, approach, or leave the car.Its keyfob battery life was also improved 8 times with an automated alert from the car if the battery gets low.
            51% of door issues were reduced as several improvements were made to power front door movement and latching system with enhanced performance on steep inclines. Customer reports regarding wind noise issues were also reduced by 22%.
